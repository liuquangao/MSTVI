# MSTVI

This is the official implementation of paper "MSTVI: Multi-Scale Time-Variable Interaction for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting".

## Main Experiment

## Start
1. Install Python 3.10. For convenience, execute the following command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare Data. You can obtain the well pre-processed datasets from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Cg1KYOlzM5C7K8gK8NfC-F3EYxkM3D2?usp=sharing). Then place the downloaded data in the folder`./dataset`.

3. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment scripts for all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```
# long-term forecast
bash scripts/long_term_forecast/MSTVI/traffic.sh
```
